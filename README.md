# Final Project Webmaster Fullstack

This is a final project from Webmaster Fullstack Class from student organization BNCC BINUS@Bandung. This project is a requirement to get a project completion certificate. The task of this project is to create a General Discussion Forum Website. The work on the final project is allowed individually or in a team of a maximum of 2 people. But I chose to work with my friend because I wanted to train and familiarize myself with pair programming techniques. This project is a Fullstack project, therefore the participants are working on both the frontend and the backend as well as possible.

One of the requirements that must be met is that we must use Laravel 7 with built-in blade templating system, eloquent ORM, relationship (in model), migration, and scaffold auth. In addition, we are required to look for references and try to make it look similar to the original reference so that it is better but if you want to make a different look it is also allowed. We chose Sunib Confide as a reference for our forum website because we agree that the Sunib Confession forum has an elegant, colorful, and attractive appearance if it is used as a question and answer forum.
There are also some minimal features that must be on the forum:
- Home: the public can see the list of existing threads.
- Register and Login (please use the auth scaffold from Laravel)
- Edit Account: change password, name, or other information
- View My Profile and other people's profiles
- View the Thread along with the reply
- Can reply to threads/forums if already logged in
- Can reply to reply at least 1 level
- Can delete and edit your own reply
- Can delete and edit threads (posts) that started on their own
- Can close the thread (so it can't be replied, but not deleted)
